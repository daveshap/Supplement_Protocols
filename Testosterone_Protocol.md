# Clinically-Backed Supplements to Upregulate Testosterone

**Overview:** A variety of supplements have shown clinical evidence of actively **increasing testosterone levels** (as opposed to merely supporting general health). Below we group them into natural herbs, key nutrients, and synthetic compounds. We emphasize **short-term vs. long-term efficacy**, **stable results**, and above all **safety** (avoiding issues like insomnia). Each entry includes evidence of effectiveness and any important side effects or cautions, with references to scientific studies.

## Natural Herbs and Botanical Supplements

- **Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia):** This Southeast Asian herb has robust evidence for boosting testosterone. A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials found **significant increases in total testosterone** in men taking Tongkat Ali, including both healthy and hypogonadal men. In one meta-analysis, Tongkat Ali raised T levels with a large effect size (SMD ~1.35) and is considered a **promising, safe therapy** for male hypogonadism. Notably, studies report minimal side effects – it’s generally well tolerated with no major toxicity. In fact, some trials noted improvements in mood, energy, and reduced fatigue with Tongkat Ali use. **Safety:** No significant insomnia issues have been linked to Tongkat Ali; if anything, one study in middle-aged men found improved stress hormone profiles and quality of life (suggesting it did not disrupt sleep). Still, as with any supplement, stick to recommended doses (often ~200–400 mg of a 100:1 extract daily). 

- **Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera):** An Ayurvedic herb known for its adaptogenic (stress-relieving) effects, ashwagandha also **raises testosterone levels**. In an 8-week randomized controlled trial, men taking 600 mg/day of ashwagandha saw a **17% increase in serum testosterone**, significantly higher than the placebo group. Multiple studies support its benefits for male reproductive health – improvements in testosterone, sperm quality, and sexual well-being have been observed ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9297375/#:~:text=Conclusion)). Ashwagandha’s effects tend to build over weeks, making it suitable for **long-term use**. **Safety:** It is generally safe and even known to reduce stress and anxiety, which can indirectly aid testosterone. It usually **promotes better sleep** rather than causing insomnia (some use it to improve sleep quality). Mild side effects like upset stomach are rare; high doses may cause drowsiness in some, so start with the recommended dose (300–600 mg/day) and avoid combining with sedatives.

- **Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum):** Fenugreek seed extracts (often standardized to a compound called *fenuside* or Testofen®) have shown the ability to **boost testosterone**, especially free testosterone. In one 8-week placebo-controlled study with resistance-trained men, those taking a fenugreek glycoside supplement (600 mg/day) had nearly a **2× increase in free testosterone levels** (about +98% from baseline, vs. +49% in the placebo group). Total testosterone also rose slightly, and fenugreek users saw improvements in strength and body fat compared to placebo. The mechanism may involve **inhibiting testosterone conversion to estrogen and DHT**, thereby increasing bioavailable testosterone. **Safety:** Fenugreek is generally safe; no serious adverse effects were noted in trials. Some users report a maple-syrup-like odor in sweat or urine (due to a compound called sotolon). It typically *does not cause insomnia* – if anything, it has a calming effect for some. Minor side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort, so taking it with meals is advisable.

- **Shilajit:** Shilajit is a mineral-rich resin from the Himalayas used in Ayurvedic medicine. A **clinical trial in healthy men (45–55 years)** found that purified shilajit (500 mg/day for 90 days) significantly **increased total and free testosterone levels** compared to placebo. The men taking shilajit saw notable rises in DHEA-S as well, while their luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) remained stable. This suggests shilajit upregulates testicular function (possibly by enhancing mitochondrial function in testosterone-producing cells). Some reports indicate around a **20% increase in testosterone** after 3 months of use. **Safety:** Pure, processed shilajit is considered safe for long-term use; no significant side effects were reported in the 90-day trial. It’s important to use **high-quality, purified shilajit** – raw shilajit can contain heavy metals or contaminants. When purified, typical doses (250–500 mg twice daily) did not cause insomnia or stimulant-like effects. However, due to its mineral content, taking it late at night on an empty stomach could potentially cause mild stomach upset in sensitive individuals.

- **Mucuna pruriens (Velvet bean):** Mucuna pruriens seeds are high in L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine. Clinically, this herb has been studied primarily in men with infertility or high stress, where it was shown to **restore testosterone levels and improve sperm quality**. In one study, infertile men took Mucuna seed powder for 3 months; results showed **significant increases in testosterone and LH** (luteinizing hormone) and a reduction in excessive FSH and prolactin, aligning their hormone levels closer to fertile men. The stress-lowering effect of Mucuna (via increasing dopamine and reducing cortisol) likely contributes to the T boost. **Safety:** Mucuna is generally safe in doses around 5 grams of seed powder daily (used in studies). By lowering stress, it may actually improve sleep in some individuals. That said, because it increases dopamine and adrenaline levels, a few people experience mild side effects like headaches, nausea, or restlessness – to avoid insomnia, it’s best to **take it in the morning or afternoon** rather than at night. Those on medications for Parkinson’s or psychiatric conditions should consult a doctor due to the L-DOPA content.

- **Tribulus terrestris:** Tribulus is a vine often marketed as a testosterone booster. **Human studies on tribulus show mixed results** – some find no effect on testosterone, while others report modest increases. For example, a few studies (involving athletes and men with sexual dysfunction) noted significant rises in testosterone with tribulus supplementation, but **other trials found no change**. A systematic review of tribulus in active males concluded there’s *no clear evidence* of consistent testosterone elevation, though it may improve libido or sexual function in certain cases. Tribulus seems more effective if a person has below-normal T or sexual symptoms, rather than in young healthy athletes. **Safety:** Standard doses (200–750 mg/day) are usually well tolerated with minimal side effects and no liver/kidney toxicity. **Higher doses (≥1000 mg/day)**, however, have been linked to adverse effects: some case reports note **sleep disturbances, agitation, increased heart rate, or hypertension** at very high intakes. There have been rare reports of gynaecomastia (male breast enlargement) or priapism (persistent erection) in unusual cases. To be safe, stay within recommended dosing, and if you experience insomnia or restlessness on tribulus, consider lowering the dose or taking it earlier in the day.

*Note:* Other herbal supplements sometimes suggested for testosterone (like **Maca root, Ginseng, or Fadogia agrestis**) either lack strong human evidence or primarily improve libido rather than T levels. Maca, for instance, can enhance sexual desire but doesn’t raise testosterone in studies. The herbs listed above have **human clinical data** indicating direct testosterone upregulation.

## Key Vitamins and Minerals

Ensuring adequate micronutrients is crucial for testosterone production. The following vitamins/minerals have clinical backing for boosting T, particularly if the individual is deficient:

- **Vitamin D:** Vitamin D functions like a hormone, and receptors for it are present in testicular tissue. Men with vitamin D deficiency often have lower testosterone. Supplementing vitamin D can **increase testosterone in those who are deficient**. In a year-long RCT, overweight men with low vitamin D (<50 nmol/L) took 3,332 IU daily; **total testosterone rose from ~10.7 to 13.4 nmol/L** on average (a ~25% increase), while no change occurred in the placebo group. Free and bioactive T also increased significantly in the vitamin D group. However, trials in men with already sufficient vitamin D have shown **no significant T boost**, indicating the effect is mainly in those correcting a deficiency. **Safety:** Vitamin D is safe at moderate doses (1,000–4,000 IU daily for maintenance, or higher under medical supervision if deficient). It generally **does not cause insomnia** – some people actually report better sleep when vitamin D levels are normalized. Extremely high doses can cause elevated calcium levels, so stick to recommended doses and consider periodic blood tests. 

- **Zinc:** Zinc is an essential mineral for testosterone synthesis. Even mild zinc deficiency can depress T levels, while zinc repletion can raise them. A classic study found that young men put on a low-zinc diet for 20 weeks had a **dramatic drop in testosterone** (from ~39.9 nmol/L to 10.6 nmol/L), essentially inducing hypogonadism. Conversely, older men with low zinc status who took zinc supplements for 6 months **doubled their testosterone levels** (from ~8.3 to 16.0 nmol/L). A systematic review concluded that low zinc is associated with low T, and supplementation helps when there is deficiency. For athletes, zinc may also prevent exercise-induced T declines. **Safety:** Zinc is best obtained through a balanced diet or low-dose supplement (e.g. 15–30 mg daily). Higher doses (50+ mg daily) for prolonged periods should be supervised, as they can cause copper deficiency or gastrointestinal upset. Signs of too much zinc include nausea or interference with sleep, but zinc itself isn’t typically stimulating. Taking zinc in the evening is fine for most people, and some find it can even improve sleep quality (zinc is involved in CNS function). Always take zinc with food to avoid nausea, and avoid going over ~40 mg/day long-term unless directed by a doctor.

- **Magnesium:** Magnesium plays a role in hundreds of enzymatic reactions, including those involved in testosterone production and hormonal balance. Research indicates magnesium supplementation can **increase both free and total testosterone**, especially in active individuals. In one trial, sedentary men and athletes were given 10 mg/kg of magnesium daily for 4 weeks. **Total and free T levels increased in both groups**, with the *largest T gains in the exercising athletes* who took magnesium. Magnesium likely improves bioavailable testosterone by reducing SHBG binding and by helping muscles relax (indirectly lowering cortisol). It’s also been noted that magnesium-deficient men often have lower T. **Safety:** Magnesium is generally very safe; common forms include magnesium citrate, glycinate or aspartate. A possible side effect is **loose stools/diarrhea** if too much is taken at once (especially magnesium oxide, which is less absorbed). Splitting the dose or using a gentler form (glycinate) helps. Magnesium tends to have a calming effect on the nervous system and **may improve sleep**, rather than disrupt it, so it’s fine to take in the evening. Just avoid extremely high doses beyond the tolerable limit (~350-400 mg elemental Mg from supplements per day for adults) to prevent digestive upset.

- **Boron:** Though not as commonly discussed, boron is a trace mineral with interesting effects on steroid hormones. Clinical evidence (albeit from small studies) shows that **boron supplementation can raise testosterone activity**. For example, in healthy men taking 6 mg of boron daily for just one week, researchers observed a **significant increase in free (active) testosterone** and a decrease in estradiol. In that study, average free T rose from 11.8 pg/mL to 15.1 pg/mL in a week, while estrogen (E2) dropped nearly 40%. Boron appears to reduce SHBG binding and modulate enzymes, effectively *amplifying androgen levels*. Other research in postmenopausal women found boron increased total testosterone and estrogen when their diets were low in these minerals. Thus, boron may help elevate low-normal hormone levels. **Safety:** In human studies, doses of 3–10 mg per day of boron were used and found to be safe, with **no adverse effects noted at these levels**. The upper limit is around 20 mg/day for adults, beyond which toxicity could theoretically occur (signs might include nausea, headache, or in extreme cases hormonal disruption). Stick to ~3–10 mg/day if you choose to supplement. Notably, boron is not a stimulant and is not known to affect sleep – some users actually report mental clarity and reduced inflammation. As always, take as directed (and if you eat plenty of fruits, veggies, nuts, you likely get a few mg of boron from diet already).

*(Note: Other vitamins like **B6**, **B12**, and minerals like **Selenium** are important for general health and reproduction but don’t have strong evidence of directly upregulating testosterone unless a severe deficiency is present. Ensuring a balanced diet and adequate multivitamin intake can “support” testosterone, but the items above have more direct research on increasing T levels.)*

## Hormonal and Synthetic Compounds

Certain compounds (including some that are technically medications) can actively increase testosterone by affecting hormone pathways. These tend to have more pronounced effects but also require careful use and medical guidance for safety:

- **DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone):** DHEA is a hormone precursor produced by the adrenal glands that can convert into testosterone (and estrogen) in the body. It’s available as an over-the-counter supplement in many countries. Research on DHEA shows it can **modestly increase testosterone, particularly free testosterone, in middle-aged and older adults or those with low DHEA**. For example, a study on men (~49 years old) doing high-intensity interval training found that taking **50 mg of DHEA before exercise prevented the usual drop in testosterone and actually elevated free testosterone above baseline** ([Effect of acute DHEA administration on free testosterone in middle-aged and young men following high-intensity interval training - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23417481/#:~:text=young%20control%20group,benefits%20related%20to%20HIIT%20adaptation)). The DHEA group maintained higher free T during recovery, whereas without DHEA their free T would have declined with intense exercise. Another trial reported that daily DHEA (50 mg for 6 months) in men and women ~65 years old led to slight increases in bioavailable testosterone, though effects on muscle and mood were minimal. Overall, DHEA’s testosterone-boosting effect is more evident in those over 40 or with low DHEA-sulfate levels. It’s **less likely to raise T in young, healthy men** (who naturally produce plenty). **Safety:** DHEA is a **hormonal supplement**, so caution is warranted. It can convert to estrogen as well – in men, excessive DHEA might elevate estrogen or DHT levels. Common side effects (especially at higher doses like 100+ mg) include oily skin, acne, hair loss (male-pattern), irritability, or insomnia in some cases (because DHEA may have a mild stimulating effect – the body typically produces it in the morning). To avoid sleep issues, take DHEA in the morning. Women should use DHEA only with medical advice, as it can cause acne or facial hair. Men with prostate issues or anyone with hormone-sensitive cancer history should consult a doctor before use. Also, note that DHEA is banned in athletic organizations (it’s on WADA’s list of prohibited substances). For healthy adults, a low dose (25–50 mg/day) is usually well tolerated – periodic blood tests can monitor testosterone and estradiol levels during use.

- **Clomiphene Citrate (SERM):** Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, technically a prescription fertility medication, but it’s used off-label to boost testosterone in men. It works by blocking estrogen’s feedback in the hypothalamus/pituitary, thus **increasing LH and FSH secretion, which stimulates the testes to produce more testosterone**. Clomiphene is **clinically proven to raise testosterone** in men with low or borderline-low T. For instance, in hypogonadal men (with low T), low-dose clomiphene (25 mg every other day) increased total testosterone from a median ~9 nmol/L into the mid-normal range (~16 nmol/L) within 1–2 months. In a large study (153 men, ages 22–80) treated long-term, 89% responded with higher T levels, often roughly doubling their baseline values. These improvements were sustained over several years of therapy, indicating durable results as long as the medication is continued. **Advantages:** Unlike direct testosterone therapy, clomiphene **maintains fertility/sperm production** (since it stimulates natural gonadotropins) and avoids large swings in hormone levels. **Safety:** Clomiphene is generally well tolerated, but it can cause some side effects. About 5–10% of men report symptoms such as **hot flashes**, mood swings or irritability, **agitation/restlessness**, or visual disturbances (like brief blurring of vision). A few get mild breast tenderness due to slight increases in circulating estrogen (though clomiphene raises T/E ratio overall). Insomnia is not commonly reported with clomiphene, but if hot flashes or agitation occur, they might interfere with sleep in sensitive individuals. These side effects are usually dose-dependent; using the lowest effective dose (12.5–25 mg on alternate days) mitigates them. Regular monitoring of testosterone, estradiol, and hematocrit is recommended during therapy. Clomiphene is an Rx drug, so a doctor’s evaluation is needed – but it’s an important option for men seeking a long-term testosterone boost without resorting to anabolic steroids. (A related medication, **enclomiphene**, is the isolated isomer focused on raising T and is in development for male hypogonadism – it works similarly by increasing LH/FSH.)

- **D-Aspartic Acid (DAA):** DAA is an amino acid present in neuroendocrine tissues, and it gained popularity as a testosterone booster. Early research was promising: a study in young men reported that **3 grams of D-aspartic acid daily increased testosterone by ~42% in 12 days**. This led to DAA being included in many “T booster” supplements. However, follow-up studies have been mixed. In resistance-trained men, 3 g/day for 1–3 months often showed **no significant T increase** and no performance benefit. In fact, a higher dose (6 g/day) of DAA for 2 weeks *reduced* testosterone by about 12% in trained men, likely due to negative feedback on the HPT axis. The consensus is that DAA might help if someone has below-normal testosterone or is untrained (short-term boost), but it **fails to raise T in many eugonadal men** and can even backfire at high doses. Any T increase from DAA tends to plateau quickly (within 2–4 weeks). **Safety:** DAA is generally safe at 3 g/day for a month – no serious adverse effects were noted in studies. Some users report headaches, irritability, or insomnia-like symptoms anecdotally, possibly from increased neurotransmitter activity (as DAA can act in the brain). If you try DAA, use 2–3 g per day and limit use to 2–4 weeks on followed by a break, to avoid potential down-regulation of your hormonal axis. Given the inconsistent evidence and the fact that large doses may decrease T, DAA is a “use with caution” supplement. It’s not as reliable as the herbs or nutrients above for sustained testosterone gains.

*Other synthetic approaches:* In clinical settings, **hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)** injections are used to stimulate testosterone production (hCG mimics LH), and **aromatase inhibitors** (like anastrozole) are sometimes given to men with low T and high estrogen to raise T by reducing estrogen feedback. These **are not supplements** but prescription therapies. For completeness: low-dose anastrozole has been shown to raise testosterone and lower estradiol in older men, but it can harm cholesterol and bone density if misused. hCG therapy can significantly increase T and preserve fertility in hypogonadal men, but it requires injections and medical supervision. **Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs)**, often touted in bodybuilding, do *not* upregulate natural testosterone – in fact, they suppress it – so they are not viable for boosting your own T (and carry significant risks). When considering synthetic options, it’s best to consult an endocrinologist or urologist to weigh benefits and risks based on individual conditions.

## Safety Considerations and Final Advice

When aiming to boost testosterone, **more is not always better**. It’s crucial to prioritize safety and choose evidence-based supplements over unproven “prohormones” or dangerous substances. Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:

- **Avoiding Side Effects:** Always start with the **recommended dosage** on the supplement and see how your body reacts. Many testosterone-boosting supplements are safe at suggested doses but can cause issues if megadosed. For example, high amounts of tribulus can lead to agitation or insomnia, and excessive zinc or vitamin D can have health repercussions. If you notice stimulant-like effects (restlessness, poor sleep), try taking the supplement earlier in the day, lowering the dose, or pausing usage. Combining too many T boosters at once is not advised, as it makes it hard to pinpoint what’s causing a side effect.

- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Use:** Some supplements are suitable for long-term daily use, while others may be better cycled. *Long-term:* Ashwagandha, Tongkat Ali, magnesium, vitamin D, and clomiphene (under doctor supervision) have all been used for months or years safely in studies, with sustained benefits. *Short-term/Cycled:* D-Aspartic acid is often cycled in weeks; DHEA, if used, is sometimes cycled or periodically reassessed. Even herbal supplements can be given a “break” after 3-6 months of continuous use to ensure the body isn’t adapting – though no formal evidence of tolerance exists for most herbals. Listen to your body and consider getting blood tests every few months to track testosterone levels and health markers if you’re supplementing regularly.

- **General Health Factors:** Remember that supplements work best in conjunction with **healthy lifestyle practices**. Regular resistance exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and a balanced diet will amplify the effectiveness of any natural T booster. Many of the above supplements (like ashwagandha or magnesium) primarily help by optimizing your body’s environment (lowering stress, improving sleep, aiding nutrient status) so that testosterone can rise to its natural potential. No supplement can overcome a poor lifestyle or clinically low T due to underlying conditions – in such cases, consult a healthcare provider. If you have symptoms of low T (fatigue, low libido, etc.), a doctor can evaluate you for deficiencies (like vitamin D or zinc) or medical treatments.

- **Contraindications and Interactions:** Be cautious if you have medical conditions or take medications. For instance, if you have **sleep apnea or insomnia issues**, raising testosterone (which can influence sleep architecture) and taking stimulating supplements late in the day might exacerbate sleep problems – monitor your sleep quality. Herbs like fenugreek and ashwagandha can lower blood sugar and blood pressure, so diabetics or those on antihypertensives should use them under supervision. DHEA and high-dose vitamin D should be avoided in hormone-sensitive cancers unless a doctor advises. Clomiphene or other SERMs should only be used under prescription. **Always check with a healthcare professional** if you’re unsure, especially when stacking multiple supplements.

**Bottom Line:** There are several **clinically-supported supplements** that can *actively upregulate testosterone*, ranging from well-known herbs (Tongkat Ali, ashwagandha, fenugreek) to vital nutrients (vitamin D, zinc) and certain hormonal compounds (DHEA, clomiphene). Many provide moderate increases in T that are **stable and sustainable** with continued use – for example, ashwagandha and Tongkat Ali can maintain higher T as long as you take them, and vitamin D or zinc will help keep T at optimal levels if you were deficient. These options generally have a **good safety profile** and a low incidence of side effects when used responsibly. By contrast, compounds with more *dramatic* short-term effects (like very high-dose DAA or unregulated “prohormones”) often fail to produce lasting benefits and carry more risks. Prioritize proven supplements, stick to recommended doses, and consider periodic bloodwork to track your progress. With a smart approach, you can support and even nudge up your testosterone levels naturally while **avoiding pitfalls** like insomnia, hormonal imbalances, or other side effects. Always keep your overall health in focus – optimizing testosterone should be part of a holistic wellness strategy supported by science and safety.

**Sources:** The effectiveness claims above are backed by clinical research. For example, Tongkat Ali’s benefits are documented in meta-analysis data, ashwagandha’s in RCTs showing significant testosterone increases, and fenugreek’s in controlled trials. Key nutrient impacts are shown in studies on zinc and vitamin D. Magnesium’s role in boosting T with exercise is supported by trials, while boron’s unique hormone effects come from human supplementation studies. DHEA’s ability to raise free T in middle-aged men is demonstrated in clinical research ([Effect of acute DHEA administration on free testosterone in middle-aged and young men following high-intensity interval training - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23417481/#:~:text=young%20control%20group,benefits%20related%20to%20HIIT%20adaptation)). Clomiphene’s long-term efficacy and safety in hypogonadal men is reported in medical literature. We’ve cited these and other peer-reviewed sources throughout to ensure information accuracy and reliability. Always refer to such evidence when choosing a supplement regimen for hormonal health.
